In this task, we used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to perform both linear and non-linear classification on a binary classification dataset, specifically the Breast Cancer dataset. The process involved loading and preparing the data, training SVM models with both linear and RBF kernels, and visualizing the decision boundaries using two features for clear interpretation. We tuned key hyperparameters such as C and gamma to optimize model performance and used cross-validation to evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our models. Through this exercise, we gained practical experience with important SVM concepts including margin maximization, the kernel trick, and hyperparameter tuning, as well as model evaluation using standard metrics.
